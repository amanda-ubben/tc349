 <h2>My Analysis</h2>
 <p>The first sort was the way I was going to structure my site. I thought the About Me section would allow me to show my resume and skills, my portfolio was going to showcase my web and graphic design work, and the blog was going to showcase my current project and give visitors a step by step look at how it was going. I really wanted my blog to act as the main page of site and then visitors could find the other ares if they were interested.</p>
 <p> All four sorts agreed on main parts of the web site structure however there were a few that they placed elsewhere. In Sort #2 and 4, they felt that past work belonged in the portfolio because it was already completed and something that could be shown for review.  In Sort #3, they felt that Skills belonged in portfolio to help better explain what tools were used to accomplish the projects shown. After looking at all the sorts I think that I would choose to structure my site using Sorts 2 and 4 because it would provide a more cohesive feeling to the site and make it easier access for visitors.</p>
