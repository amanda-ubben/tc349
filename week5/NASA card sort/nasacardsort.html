 <h2>My Analysis</h2>
 <p>My sort differed from the current site structure because I felt the important moon related topics should be grouped together. I choose to put International Observe the Moon Night and Celebrate the Moon under the category of About the Moon because they related more closely to that topic than News and Events. I also believed that Products belonged on the Home page because it just felt stuffed into Multimedia and I didn't see the connection between Products and Multimedia. I also felt that visitors would be able to find products better if it were listed on the Home page.</p>
 <p>The other sorts only slightly differed from my sort on a few occasions. In Sort #2 they felt that the Moon Map belonged under the About the Moon category. They explained that because it is a map of the Moon it should be more closely related to the information about the moon. In Sort #3 they moved the calendar to the Home page. It was explained to me that they would like to see it on home page because it is quick access to important dates that they would like. In Sort #4 they moved images to the Missions category because they felt it was a natural progression from getting information about the missions to seeing pictures about them. Overall the four sorts were similar to the organization of the original site.</p>
